# C_plus_plus_Projects
In your program, add comments that describe in English what your program does. In the comment, identify the requirement that the next line of code addresses from requirements 3-9:
Algorithms
UML diagrams
Inputs and Output (I/O)
Variables
Arrays
File I/O
Iteration (loops)
Interaction
Control
For requirements 1-2, update your algorithm and UML diagrams to match your final code and include them in a Word document as file types .docx, .doc, .rtf, or .pdf. If you run out of time, 
add comments to describe what is missing, noting what you need to change for the documentation to match the code.
Tip: If you had problems getting your code to compile and run, discuss it in M5 Discussion 1, and see if your classmates have suggestions. If you detect the problem later, 
write your instructor and provide a screenshot of the error you experienced. Always add a screenshot of any challenges to your documentation in your submission.
Lastly, if you have a section of code that will not compile and run and you spent an hour working on it, take a screenshot of the compile or runtime error, describe what you think went wrong. 
Add comments using // in front of the problem lines of code.
Compile and run the program to test its behavior. If all of it is not working, describe the problem. This is a natural part of the programming process and important to your understanding of how to fix errors.
Tip: If you are not sure of how to complete your program, look through the Programming Assignments for exercises that say practice. 
They include the completed code and you can study how it works and the strategies they used in your plans for refining your main program and supporting work.
